## Introduction 
In this post, I am going to talk about JSON Web Token(JWT), and how to implement it in DRF. First of all, JSON Web Token itself is just "an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object"[[1]](https://jwt.io/introduction).

However, in this post, I will refer it to as the JWT Authentication method. So, JWT is an authentication method that securely transmit user authentication information in the form of a JSON token. I will explain how it works in detail later in the post.
