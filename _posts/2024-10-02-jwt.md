## Introduction 
In this post, I am going to talk about JSON Web Token(JWT), and how to implement it in DRF. First of all, JSON Web Token itself is just "an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object"[[1]](https://jwt.io/introduction).

However, in this post, I will refer it to as the JWT Authentication method. So, JWT is an authentication method that securely transmit user authentication information in the form of a JSON token. I will explain how it works in detail later in the post.

## Structure of JSON Web Tokens
A JSON Web Token consists of three parts.
- ***Header***: typically consists of the type of the token, and the signing algorithm. It is usually _encoded_ using base64Url.
    ```JSON
    {
        "alg": "HS256",
        "typ": "JWT"
    }
    ```
- ***Payload***: contains the claims (information about user). There are three types of claims.
    - Registered Claims: provided useful and exchangable informations, such as _iss_ (issuer), _sub_ (subject), _aud_ (audience).
    - Public Claims: defined by you, according to some manuals, which will not be discussed in this post.
    ```JSON
    {
        "sub": "1234567890",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "admin": true
    }
    ```
- ***Signature***: created to make sure that the token is not forgered, or manipulated. In case your algorithm uses private key, like RSA, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.
    - Created by hashing, or encrypting, depending on your algorithm, the encoded header, payload and secret. In the case of django, the secret would be the django's secret key.
    - At the end, a JSON Web Token would look sth like this.
    ```JSON
    eyJhbGci0iJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
    eyJzdWIi0iIxMjM0NTY30DkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4
    gRG91IiwiaXNTb2NpYWwiOnRydWV9.

    ```
## JWT Auth Method Workflow 
So basically the JWT authentication method is a widely used method that uses the JSON Web Token.

**Example Login workflow using JWT**
1. User provides necessary information (e.x: email & password), through a **secured** path (e.x: https), and makes an request to server.
2. The server, in this case django, validates the information against the Database.
3. If valid, server signs and creates a JSON Web Token and return it to user.
4. User stores it in **secure** space (e.x: HttpOnly Cookie).
5. **User put it in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema** whenever make request to server
    ```JSON
    Authorization: Bearer <token>
    ```
6. Server valides user's permissions using that token in the header

I hope that example workflow was enough to grasp an insight into how JWT 
authentication method works. For more detailed information, checkout this great page
